# CompLog
This library provides a seamless compatibility layer that supports various popular Java logging frameworks, including Log4j, Logback, SLF4J, and Apache Commons Logging.
It also offers integration with java.util.logging (JUL) and includes a built-in custom logging framework.
This allows you to standardize logging across your applications, regardless of which logging framework is used.
